The root cause involves failing to handle floating-point types (Float64Type from SystemVerilog 'real') in the type conversion pipeline. The assertion on integer bitwidth is triggered because hw::getBitWidth() returns -1 for unsupported types. This suggests the issue is a known problem in the MooreToCore conversion of real type handling."
