}

Analysis:
The test case does NOT reproduce the crash with the current toolchain.
This could indicate:
1. The bug has been fixed in the current CIRCT build
2. The test case requires specific compilation flags or conditions
3. The environment differs from the original crash environment
4. The bug may be environment-dependent (architecture, LLVM version, etc.)

Original Crash Signature (from error.txt):
- Assertion: "expected 'op' to have no uses"
- Location: llvm/mlir/lib/IR/PatternMatch.cpp:156
- Function: mlir::RewriterBase::eraseOp(Operation *)
- Called from: extractConcatToConcatExtract in CombFolds.cpp:548
- Stack trace present in error.txt lines 12-56
