    "description": "No exact duplicate found. Issue #6810 is about Arc assertion support infrastructure (verif.assert and sv.assert.concurrent), which is the parent tracking issue for assertion support in Arc. However, this specific crash is about a missing lowering for sim.fmt.literal operations generated from immediate assertions with $error() messages in arcilator. The crash is more specific to the sim dialect formatting pipeline than general assertion support.",
