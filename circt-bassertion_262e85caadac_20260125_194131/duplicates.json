The closest matches involve RAUW/replaceAllUsesWith but in different contexts (Ibis dialect conversion, InnerSymbol tracking). LLHD-related issues exist but describe different failures (segfault in XorOp, legalization errors). This appears to be a unique bug in Sig2RegPass handling of self-referential assignments."
