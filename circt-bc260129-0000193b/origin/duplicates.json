    "notes": "While a very similar issue exists (9287) that addresses getBitWidth returning -1, the specific scenario with LLHD Mem2Reg pass and real type variables in clocked assignments does not appear to be explicitly reported. The crash is unique because: 1) It occurs specifically in Mem2Reg pass insertBlockArgs, 2) It involves real types with clocked assignments, 3) The -1 bitwidth propagates through hw::getBitWidth. Issue 9287 may address the root cause but should review this specific manifestation."
