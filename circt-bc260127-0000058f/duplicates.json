Issue 8930 has the most similar crash signature (dyn_cast assertion failure in MooreToCore) but is triggered by different missing conversions (real/math operations vs packed union types). The specific combination of PackedUnionType + module port + sanitizeInOut appears to be unique. However, should review issue 8930 before reporting."
