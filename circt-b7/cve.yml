"Attack type": "Local"
"Impact":
  - "Denial of Service"
"Affected component(s)": "circt-verilog,  LLHD lowering pipeline (Sig2Reg)"
"Attack vector(s)": "Compile SystemVerilog Code with both procedural and continuous assignments to the same signal (e.g., `q <= d` and `assign q = q`)"
"Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE": |
 CIRCT firtool-1.139.0 and earlier contains a vulnerability in the LLHD Sig2Reg pass. 
 Signals with overlapping or conflicting drivers (e.g., `q <= d` and `assign q = q` ) are not properly detected.
 This can cause the compiler to hang, resulting in denial of service in automated or multi-user compilation environments.
