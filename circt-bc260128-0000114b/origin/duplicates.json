  "summary": "The crash appears to be a new/undiscovered issue specific to InferStateProperties.cpp:211. Issue #6373 is the most similar (handling struct types in arc), but it focuses on arc.tap and hw.wire, not on hw.ConstantOp creation with struct types. The root cause (attempting to create hw.ConstantOp with struct type) appears to be a new scenario not covered by existing issues. Recommended action: file as new issue with strong reference to #6373 as related."
