Issue #3289 (score 6.5): Type::cast assertion crash, but in CombOps.ConcatOp, not in hw::ConstantOp. Different dialect (PyCDE/Comb vs Arc).\n3. Issue #6373 (score 4.0): Arc aggregate types, but for struct validation, not state property transformation.\n\nKey differences from the crash report:\n- Root cause: applyEnableTransformation attempting hw::ConstantOp::create with ArrayType (not IntegerType)\n- Component: Arc/InferStatePropertiesPass, not other dialects\n- Trigger: Array-typed state variables in always_ff blocks with enable patterns\n- Stack trace: InferStateProperties.cpp:211 specific assertion\n\nThis crash has NOT been reported before in these exact circumstances.",
