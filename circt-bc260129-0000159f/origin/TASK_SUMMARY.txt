================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT CREATE A NEW ISSUE

Action Items:
  1. Reference Issue #9574 in all bug documentation
  2. Subscribe to Issue #9574 for updates and fixes
  3. Check Issue #9574 for any proposed solutions or workarounds
  4. Monitor Issue #9574 for commit-based fixes

Why Not Report:
  - Exact duplicate already exists (Issue #9574)
  - Same error, same root cause, same tool, same dialect
  - Creating duplicate wastes maintainer time
  - Consolidates efforts on existing issue
  - Allows single point of tracking

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Bug Severity: HIGH
Type: Assertion Failure
Affected Component: Arc dialect LowerState pass
User Impact: Blocks compilation of Verilog with inout ports

Status: ALREADY REPORTED (Issue #9574)
- No need to duplicate report
- Developers are already aware
- Issue is in the open tracker

================================================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Root Cause:
The Arc dialect's StateType requires its underlying type to have a known
concrete bit width. However, LLHD reference types (!llhd.ref<T>) are opaque
pointer types without concrete bit widths. When the LowerState pass attempts
to create a StateType with an LLHD reference type, the verification fails.

Trigger Pattern:
Input: Verilog module with inout port
  → circt-verilog: converts to CIRCT IR (inout → !llhd.ref<i1>)
  → arcilator: attempts to lower Arc dialect
  → LowerState pass: calls StateType::get() with !llhd.ref<i1>
  → Verification: fails in StorageUniquerSupport.h:180

Error Chain:
  StateType::get() 
    → verifyInvariants()
    → Assertion failure (bit width check)

================================================================================
VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Verification Status: CONFIRMED
  ✓ Crash signature matches exactly
  ✓ All 8 search queries confirm finding
  ✓ Issue #9574 exists in repository
  ✓ Issue details align perfectly
  ✓ No conflicting information

Confidence Level: VERY HIGH (95%)
  - Multiple search queries converge on same result
  - Error message is specific and unique
  - Tool + dialect + pass combination is distinctive
  - Recent creation date aligns with test case date

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This test case (260129-0000159f) represents an EXACT DUPLICATE of
Issue #9574 in the CIRCT GitHub repository.

ACTION: DO NOT REPORT - REFERENCE EXISTING ISSUE #9574 INSTEAD

The duplicate check was thorough and comprehensive:
  - 8 different search queries covering all aspects of the crash
  - 100% convergence on Issue #9574
  - No conflicting or ambiguous results
  - High confidence verdict with documented evidence
