  "analysis": "The crash signature 'dyn_cast on a non-existent value' matches issue #8219 exactly. However, that issue is CLOSED and in a different subsystem (ESI). The current crash occurs in MooreToCore/PortImplementation.h, and the root cause is unpacked array of strings not being properly handled during port conversion, yielding a null type. While #8219 has the same error message, it's in a different context. Issue #8276 is the most relevant OPEN issue as it directly addresses the missing UnpackedArrayType support in MooreToCore. The current crash is likely a variant or duplicate of #8276's scope. Recommendation: Review #8276 and consider this a related bug in the same feature gap.",
