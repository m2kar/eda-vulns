Different crash location: Mem2Reg.cpp:1742 (insertBlockArgs) vs Mem2Reg.cpp:1654 (insertBlockArgs parent)\n3. Different trigger: class/handle types with invalid bitwidth vs signal reference ordering\n4. The error message explicitly states 'integer bitwidth is limited to 16777215 bits' which is unique to this issue\n5. The problem occurs when processing class handle types, which is a specific type that lacks proper validation",
