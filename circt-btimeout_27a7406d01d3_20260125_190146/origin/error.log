This minimal test case demonstrates a timeout/infinite loop in the CIRCT arcilator pipeline when processing partial packed struct field assignments in always_comb blocks.

Root cause: Partial assignment to packed struct field in always_comb creates a false combinational loop when converted to hw.struct_inject operations. The arcilator LowerState pass enters an infinite loop processing the cyclic dependency.
