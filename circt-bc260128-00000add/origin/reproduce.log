CIRCT Bug Reproduction Report
========================================

Test Case ID: 260128-00000add
Source File: source.sv
Reproduction Date: 2025-01-31

--- Execution Command ---
circt-verilog --ir-hw source.sv | arcilator | opt -O0 | llc -O0 --filetype=obj -o test.o

--- Tool Information ---
Tool Version (original): circt-1.139.0
Tool Version (current):  firtool-1.139.0 + LLVM 22.0.0git
Tool Path: /opt/firtool/bin

--- Reproduction Result ---
Status: FAILED - No crash reproduced
Exit Code: 0 (Success)

--- Original Crash Signature ---
Error Type: Assertion failure in arcilator
Location: circt::arc::StateType::get() at ArcTypes.cpp.inc:108
Assertion: succeeded(ConcreteT::verifyInvariants(...))
Message: state type must have a known bit width; got '!llhd.ref<i1>'

--- Current Execution Output ---
arcilator completed successfully and generated LLVM IR output:
- Generated LLVM Module: LLVMDialectModule
- Function output: test_module_eval
- No assertion failures

--- Analysis ---
The bug does not reproduce on the current toolchain. Possible reasons:
1. The bug has been fixed in a later version of CIRCT
2. The StateType verification logic has been updated to handle llhd.ref<i1> types
3. Changes in the arcilator pass pipeline may have addressed the root cause

--- Recommendation ---
Since the bug cannot be reproduced, this issue may have been:
- Fixed in upstream CIRCT
- Fixed in current build configuration
- Dependent on specific toolchain version combination

Further investigation may require:
- Testing with circt-1.139.0 specifically (if available)
- Checking CIRCT changelog/commits between 1.139.0 and current version
- Analyzing StateType verification changes in Arc dialect
