  "analysis": "This is likely a NEW issue but shares architectural similarities with #9467. The issue is specific to immediate assertions with $error() that generate sim.fmt.literal operations in the arcilator/LowerArcToLLVM pipeline. While #9467 has similar legalization failure pattern (orphaned operation not properly handled), it concerns llhd.constant_time instead. The root cause appears unique to how sim.fmt.literal operations from immediate assertions are handled - they may lack proper consumption patterns or DCE handling in the format string lowering pipeline. Recommend filing as a new issue with reference to #9467 as a related pattern."
