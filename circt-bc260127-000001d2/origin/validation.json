    "reason": "The testcase uses valid SystemVerilog syntax (immediate assertion with $error) that is accepted by both Verilator and Slang. The crash occurs in arcilator's LowerArcToLLVM pass which fails to legalize sim.fmt.literal operations. This is a genuine bug - the format literal is correctly generated and used by sim.proc.print in the IR, but the legalization pass incorrectly marks it as illegal.",
