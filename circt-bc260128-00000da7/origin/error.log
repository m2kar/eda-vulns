Crash Type: timeout
Testcase ID: 260128-00000da7 (minimized)
Reproduction Status: CONFIRMED

--- Reproduction Command ---
timeout 60s bash -c '/edazz/FeatureFuzz-SV/target/circt-1.139.0/bin/circt-verilog --ir-hw bug.sv | /edazz/FeatureFuzz-SV/target/circt-1.139.0/bin/arcilator'

--- Result ---
Exit code: 124 (timeout after 60 seconds)

--- Analysis ---
The minimized testcase successfully reproduces the arcilator timeout bug.
The timeout occurs in the arcilator stage, not during IR generation.
circt-verilog successfully generates HW IR, but arcilator hangs processing it.

--- Environment ---
CIRCT Version: 1.139.0
Tool Path: /edazz/FeatureFuzz-SV/target/circt-1.139.0/bin/
Timeout Setting: 60s (original was 300s)
